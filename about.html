<p>I am siphosethu Tombe I live in Cape Town at Lower crossroad,Ilive with my sister.I am the kind of person who is quite in large group or in poblic.
I love to think rather than talk.You only see me when we`re close,I smile and laugh a lot,especially at the most appropriate times.I am typically sensitive to noise yet I enjoy being alone.
I am good at reading.My strength is to listen and convincing people,my weakness is when people do things without my knowledge.I did my grade 12 in 2020.</p>
